                  I started my career as a multimedia designer creating engaging
                  interactive content for an eLearning company more than 10
                  years ago.
               </p>

                  In more recent years, I've gained strong leadership skills
                  while leading a team of 4 developers, did hiring and
                  upskilling. Constantly improved the team’s skills,
                  implementing new technologies and work practices, such as
                  Sass, React, and BEM methodology, and promoted constant
                  innovation.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Drove the team’s visibility in the organisation by working
                  closely with other departments. Played a significant role in
                  promoting diversity and inclusion, and mental health within
                  the company.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I'm skilled in various web development languages such as HTML,
                  CSS/Sass, JS, jQuery, React, PHP, SQL.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I’ve always had a passion for creativity and technology. As a
                  leader, I like to focus on the growth and development of my
                  team, diversity and inclusion in the workplace, promoting
                  mental health and contribute to a great company culture.
               </p>
               <p>
                  My front-end development skills, attention to detail and
                  strong aesthetics are my superpowers.
